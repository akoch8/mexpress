MEXPRESS
========

### About

MEXPRESS is a data visualization tool designed for the easy visualization of [TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) expression, DNA methylation and clinical data, as well as the relationships between them. The first version of MEXPRESS was published in BMC Genomics: https://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/636.

Because the TCGA data was moved to the [GDC portal](https://gdc.cancer.gov/) and the original TCGA portal is no longer online, I decided to build a new version of MEXPRESS. This repository contains the code for this new version, which is still very much a work in progress! I moved all the old MEXPRESS code to the [mexpress-legacy](https://github.com/akoch8/mexpress-legacy) repository.
